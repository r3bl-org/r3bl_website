# Change master to main

The
[Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) points out](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html#rfc.section.1.1.1)
that "Master-slave is an oppressive metaphor that will and should never become fully detached from history" as well as
"In addition to being inappropriate and arcane, the
[master-slave metaphor](https://github.com/bitkeeper-scm/bitkeeper/blob/master/doc/HOWTO.ask?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha#L231-L232)
is both technically and historically inaccurate." There's lots of more accurate options depending on context and it
costs me nothing to change my vocabulary, especially if it is one less little speed bump to getting a new person excited
about tech.

You might say, "I'm all for not using master in master-slave technical relationships, but this is clearly an instance of
master-copy, not master-slave"
[but that may not be the case](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html). Turns out the
original usage of master in Git very likely came from another version control system (BitKeeper) that explicitly had a
notion of slave branches.
